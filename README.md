# Todo-List-React-App-

## Problem statement
## Create a Todolist app.


### Features: 

### Fetch and show todo items from the api - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

### Add a todo item, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and save the item in react state. (This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add items to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data. Read the guide).

### Update the item, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).

### Delete an item, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
